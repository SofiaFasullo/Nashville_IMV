Start by loading in packages

First I'll look at census data and chamber of commerce locations

#Census data
```{r}
API_key = "c03e04624fa724c446d835b3c313e3f11aa54c2d" #Sofia Fasullo's API key
census_api_key(API_key, overwrite = TRUE)

acs_variable_list.2020 <- load_variables(2020, #year
                                         "acs5")

## Set up a list of variables to grab
acs_vars <- c("B01001_001E", # ACS total Pop estimate
              "B06011_001E") # Median income in past 12 months

## Grab some data for Chester County

acs2020 <- get_acs(geography = "tract",
                   year = 2020,
                   variables = acs_vars,
                   geometry = TRUE,
                   state = "TN",
                   county = "Davidson",
                   output = "wide") %>%
  select(GEOID, NAME, acs_vars) %>%
  rename(total_pop_est = B01001_001E,
         median_income_est = B06011_001E) %>%
  mutate(year = 2020)


## Let's try getting 2010 data

acs2010 <- get_acs(geography = "tract",
                   year = 2010,
                   variables = acs_vars,
                   geometry = TRUE,
                   state = "TN",
                   county = "Davidson",
                   output = "wide") %>%
  select(GEOID, NAME, acs_vars) %>%
  rename(total_pop_est = B01001_001E,
         median_income_est = B06011_001E) %>%
  mutate(year = 2010)


full_table <- rbind(acs2010, acs2020)

```

chamber of commerce music venue data load
```{r}
cc_venues <- read_sf("~/GitHub/Nashville_IMV/data/chamber_venues/chamber_venues_2020.geojson") %>% st_transform(4269)
#what is the 0 capacity?
```

NOTE: possiblility to streamline this system in the future by reading .R files into this markdown rather than having all this code re-written

rename data so generic names from various files are given specific names in this 
```{r}
#adding an id column for ease of joins
full_table$id = seq(1:length(full_table$GEOID))
census_data = full_table
```

#Data communication
Idea is 2 different "big" tables: one organized by census tract and one organized by venue (for ease of different access)

#Task 1: join data to parent geography
```{r}
council_districts = st_read("https://data.nashville.gov/resource/iw7r-m8qr.geojson") %>% select(council_district, geometry) %>% st_transform(crs=4269)


```

```{r}
census10 = filter(census_data, year==2010)
census10[is.na(census10)] <- 0
census10$area10 = st_area(census10)
census10 = census10 %>% mutate(pop_dens10 = total_pop_est/area10, med_incxpop = median_income_est*total_pop_est)
#I made distance in square miles, not meters
council10 = st_join(council_districts,census10) %>% group_by(council_district) %>% summarize(tot_pop10 = sum(total_pop_est), avg_med_inc10 = (sum(med_incxpop)/tot_pop10), avg_dens10 = mean(pop_dens10)*2590000)


census20 = filter(census_data, year==2020)
census20[is.na(census20)] <- 0
census20$area20 = st_area(census20)
census20 = census20 %>% mutate(pop_dens20 = total_pop_est/area20, med_incxpop = median_income_est*total_pop_est)
council20 = st_join(council_districts,census20) %>% group_by(council_district) %>% summarize(tot_pop20 = sum(total_pop_est), avg_med_inc20 = (sum(med_incxpop)/tot_pop20), avg_dens20 = mean(pop_dens20)*2590000)

#parent geography with aggregated census data from both years
coun_dist = 
  left_join(st_drop_geometry(council10), st_drop_geometry(council20), by="council_district") %>%
  left_join(.,council_districts,by="council_district") %>%
  st_as_sf() %>% 
  mutate(perc_chg_pop = round(((tot_pop20-tot_pop10)/tot_pop10)*100,1), perc_chg_med_inc = round(((avg_med_inc20-avg_med_inc10)/avg_med_inc10)*100,1), perc_chg_dens = round(((avg_dens20-avg_dens10)/avg_dens10)*100,1))


```

```{r}
#joining venue data to this
coun_dist_venues = st_join(coun_dist, cc_venues) %>% group_by(council_district) %>% 
  summarize(num_venues = n(), avg_capacity = round(mean(Capacity))) %>% #not sure why NAs are introduced
  left_join(., st_drop_geometry(coun_dist), by="council_district")
  
```


```{r}
cc_venues_dist = st_join(cc_venues,coun_dist)

## Task 2 = Make Sense of Administrative Data

```{r}
#data has APN and address
LIS23 = st_read("C:/Users/sofia/Documents/GitHub/Nashville_IMV/data/metro/Prop_LIS_Jan_2023/Prop_LIS_Jan_2023.shp") %>% st_transform(4269)
parcels = st_read("C:/Users/sofia/Documents/GitHub/Nashville_IMV/data/metro/Nashville_Parcel_data.shp") %>% st_transform(4269)
```

```{r}
#loading populated database as of 4/16/2023, but only the venue names and locations

#283 venues, goal is to have all 938 assigned an APN value

work_table  = select(pop_venue_db,Address_Full, Address_Number)

Demographic Change
Gentrification
 - all this over time
 - income and race, age, industry (QCAW)
wage stagnation
  - profit?
  - QCAW
  - where people travel for work
Diversity in ownership
