# 1. Key Takeaways

# 2. Data Sources

- IMV data set

- Chamber of Commerce Data (link)

- US Census

- Nashville Metro Cadastral

- Nashville Metro Parcels

- Nashville Metro Fire Inspection Data

- Nashville Planning Districts

# 3. Methods

What did we do?

We collected the data set with liaisons, community members and desk research (this will be covered by VL in the report)

We related each venue to it's APN number (a property identifier) and joined it to tax records, license records.

We created variables for knn sq ft costs, dist to CBD centroid, joined venues to districts

# 4. Venue Database

Let's give descriptive statistics for the venue database

- How many venues

- Where are they located? - Fishnet heatmap, Point map, Symbologized by planning area.

- How many are independently owned and booked?

- Histogram of capacities (facetted by indie/non)

- What percentage of total capacity is independent vs. corporate?

- Bar plots of programming variables (facetted by indie/non)

- What is the distribution of programming variables?

- How does this compare to other cities in CFP database?

# 5. Venues and The City

- Venue zoning districts (bar plot)

- Venue square foot sales values and gross sales values (histogram, inflation adjusted)

- Venues by planning area / neighborhood

- Surface map of real estate values by square foot with indie venues on top

- k=5 mean square footage costs of recent sales (inflation adjusted) for indies

- Relationship between programming scores and real estate value

- Comparison to CFP cities - programming and real estate relationships

- Programming, cost and relationship to distance to CBD

# 6. Venues and Regulation

- What kind of licenses are associated with these venues?

- What about the ones that primarily hold shows (e.g. 10+ per month)

# 7. Venues and Threats

- What are the venues listed as threatened, where are they? What are their characteristics?

- What properties have the highest disparity between estimated square footage value and assessed value?

# 8. Change in Nashville

- Map of change in rents by census tract (over 10 years)

- Identification of development "hot spots" and related venues

- What are the areas of opportunity (e.g. can we ID relatively lower rent areas with high percentages of young adults, reasonable proximity to downtown?)
