#### Data cleaning script
### Purpose: clean Nashville music venue database to be in a format that can join easily with other datasets

## load libraries
library(tidyverse)
library(sf)
library(dplyr)


### Task 1: Re-format addresses to be consistent with administrative data

## loading manually populated venue database (as of 4/16/2023) and rename to match CFP naming conventions

## select only the two address columns from venue database to have a simpler table to work with

## select only the two address column to match and APN column from tax parcel data to have a simpler table to work with

## create empty "APN_Address" column to populate with venue address formated like tax parcel data addresses

## remove trailing new lines

## swap nomenclature (and a few specific outliers)

## join by address to tax parcel data - 170 out of 283 joined by address

#out of first 10 unjoined addresses, 8 are because the address doesn't exist in the parcels dataset---> probabilistic match will likely not be accurate, have to go in manually

## save a local version of a full table of venues (those joined to administrative data and those unmatched) to manually match the rest

### Task 2: Manually add in any missing addresses that need to match administrative data, and join final address list to administrative data


## manually match the unmatched venues by going through a map of the parcel data and finding the parcel that overlaps the venue location and bringing this parcel's address into the column "APN_Address_Manual"
## put a copy of this manually matched table into "~/Github/Nashville_IMV/data/venue_tables/manual_APNs[date].csv" with date of last VENUE TABLE update

## load back in the manually matched database of venues <--> parcels that I made (last updated 6/7/2023)

## view which addresses weren't joined and why - should only be venues not in study area or with insufficient data
APN_nomatch = left_join(manual_match_table, work_join_table, by = c("APN_Address"="PropAddr")) %>% filter(is.na("APN")) %>% unique()

## creating useful tables

## simple table (use for all administrative and venue data joins), also rename to match CFP naming conventions
venue_admin_key_table = select(APN_join2, c(name, APN_Address_Manual, APN)) %>% rename(address_admin=APN_Address_Manual)

## join correct coordinate info
venue_data_join = left_join(venue_admin_key_table, pop_venue_db, by="name") %>% rename(APN=APN.x) %>% select(-c(APN.y,street))

venue_coordinates = APN_join2 %>% select(c(name,geometry))

## detailed table (all venue and parcel information) - lots of redundant info so commented out
#detailed_table = left_join(venue_data_done,parcels,by= c("Admin_Address"="PropAddr","APN")) %>% unique()

## if updated, save the important tables to Github

## save simple table (for joins) with date of last VENUE TABLE update
#write.csv(venue_admin_key_table,"~/Github/Nashville_IMV/data/venue_tables/simple_table_[date].csv")

## save venue table to Github with date of last VENUE TABLE update (remember, this is just the manually updated venue list with all the information filled in)
#write.csv(venue_data_done,"~/Github/Nashville_IMV/data/venue_tables/venue_table_filled_[date].csv")


### Task 3: Re-organize rest of venue attribute data

## manually download and edit venue dataset and save to Github folder

## RIGHT AFTER UPDATE load detailed venue dataset, pay mind to last update
#venue_table_detailed_load = read.csv("~/Github/Nashville_IMV/data/venue_tables/venue_table_detailed_7_3.csv", header=T)

## merge this with venue_data_done dataset to ensure all venues are counted #25 venues without APNs due to difference between dates of last updated tables
#venue_table_detailed = left_join(select(venue_table_detailed_load,-c(address,address_admin,APN,url,zip,county,city,y,x)),venue_data_done,by = "name")
